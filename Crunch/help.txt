SYNOPSIS
       crunch <min-len> <max-len> [<charset string>] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Crunch can create a wordlist based on criteria you specify.  The output from crunch can be sent to the file.  

The required parameters are:

       min-len
              The minimum length string you want crunch to start at.  This option is  required  even  for  parameters
              that won't use the value.

       max-len
              The  maximum length string you want crunch to end at.  This option is required even for parameters that
              won't use the value.

OPTIONS
       -d    This option gives the dataset to the function that is to be used. The parameters can be :
	     num:    	   This will povide the data set all the numeric digits "0123456789".
	     lower:  	   This will povide the data set all lower alphabets "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm".
	     upper:        This will povide the data set all UPPER alphabets "QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM".
	     lownum: 	   This will povide the data set all lower alphabets and the numerics. 
	     upnum:  	   This will povide the data set all UPPER alphabets and the numerics.
	     all[DEFAULT]: This will povide the data set all UPPER alphabets, lower alphabets and the numerics.	

	Ex: crunch 2 3 -d num 
       

       -ds    This option is used to give a  custom  dataset  to crunch it. This  option is followed by  the string  
	      contaning all the character you want.

	Ex: crunch 2 3 -ds qwer3456

        
       -r :
              This option is used when you have to pass a custom incomplete string and perform combinations to get all
              the possible string. This option is followed by a custom string. "@" is used to represent the missing 
	      character in a string.
	NOTE: The min-length, max-length and count of "@" in string should all be same.

	Ex: crunch 3 3 -r a@u@@m 

EXAMPLES
       Example 1
       crunch 1 8
       crunch will create a wordlist that starts at 0 and ends at ZZZZZZZZ

       Example 2
       crunch 1 6 -d num
       crunch will create a wordlist using the character set "0123456789" that starts at 0 and ends at 999999.

       Example 3
       crunch 1 6 -ds qwert
       crunch will create a wordlist using the character set "qwert" that starts at q and ends at tttttt.

       Example 4
       crunch 3 3 -d num -r a@u@@m 
       crunch will use the numeric dataset "0123456789"  and make a every possible word replaceing the in given
       string.
